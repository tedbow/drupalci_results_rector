Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Installation request for drupal/ace_editor 1.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/ace_editor[1.x-dev].
    - drupal/ace_editor 1.x-dev requires npm-asset/ace-builds ~1.0 -> no matching package found.

Potential causes:
 - A typo in the package name
 - The package is not available in a stable-enough version according to your minimum-stability setting
   see <https://getcomposer.org/doc/04-schema.md#minimum-stability> for more details.
 - It's a private package and you forgot to add a custom repository to find it

Read <https://getcomposer.org/doc/articles/troubleshooting.md> for further common problems.

Installation failed, reverting ./composer.json to its original content.
