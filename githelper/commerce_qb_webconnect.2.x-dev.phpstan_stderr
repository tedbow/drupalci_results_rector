Your requirements could not be resolved to an installable set of packages.

  Problem 1
    - Installation request for drupal/commerce_qb_webconnect 2.x-dev -> satisfiable by drupal/commerce_qb_webconnect[2.x-dev].
    - drupal/commerce_qb_webconnect 2.x-dev requires ext-soap * -> the requested PHP extension soap is missing from your system.
